#  Sprint Challenge Solution: Intro to Python

## Rubric

The grading rubric for this Sprint Challenge is as follows:

3: All tests passing along with the stretch goal tests passing as well.

2: All tests passing for non-stretch problems except for the `cityreader` exercise. While the student may not have necessarily gotten all the `cityreader` tests to pass, it should be clear to you that they put in a strong effort to completing this problem in their submission. A clear example of this would be if their implementation's output doesn't exactly match the output expected by the tests, but that their implementation _does_ output something reasonable, even if it doesn't exactly match the expected output. 

1: Any tests in other sections failing and/or little to no effort shown for the `cityreader` exercise.
